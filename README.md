# ALIGNING AI SYSTEMS WITH CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY AND CSR STRATEGIES
### Providing Actionable Insights and Guidelines for Enhanced Integration

This thesis investigates the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within corporate sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategies, examining its applications, alignment, and potential enhancements. The study utilizes a multi-method approach, comprising a literature review, interviews with three companies, and a sustainability study of three tools - one from each company. The literature review identifies the broad landscape of AI applications in business operations, ethical considerations, and governance frameworks. Interviews provide practical insights into AI's deployment in diverse areas such as logistics optimization, customer engagement, and sustainability reporting. The sustainability study evaluates AI tools using the Sustainability Awareness Framework (SusAF), assessing their alignment with corporate sustainability goals.

Key findings reveal that AI can enhance operational efficiency, decision-making, and stakeholder engagement, supporting the holistic development of sustainability strategies. However, challenges such as data privacy, transparency, and ethical implications must be addressed. The research identifies twelve critical themes for aligning AI with sustainability and CSR:

- Holistic Organizational Approach
- Sustainability Impact Assessment
- Frugal AI Development
- Ethical Considerations
- Stakeholder Engagement
- Measurement and Monitoring
- Adaptive Management
- Knowledge Sharing and Transparency
- Resource Optimization
- Compliance and Beyond
- Innovation for Sustainability
- Data Integration and Interoperability

The study proposes that embedding sustainability considerations from the outset of AI system development, including the use of frugal and explainable AI, is necessary. Future research should focus on enhancing data integration, development of clear, measurable KPIs for the purpose of better understanding the alignment of AI systems or tools with sustainability goals, and the creation of regulatory frameworks that support ethical AI development and mitigate potential negative impacts on sociopolitical and socioeconomic fronts. These steps are essential for ensuring that AI technologies contribute positively to environmental, social, and economic dimensions, fostering a sustainable future for businesses.
